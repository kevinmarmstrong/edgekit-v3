          '`pnpm research:suite` is the broader tuning loop. It reads scenario packs from `evals/agent-suite/scenarios.json`, applies thresholds from `evals/agent-suite/rubric.json`, runs seeded prompt variants across browser demos, and executes architecture probes that cannot be safely exposed from GitHub Pages.',
          'The suite covers Chrome AI/WebLLM/provider fallback behavior, hybrid cloud-route selection, supervisor handoffs, response caching, tool repair, MCP adapters, tool policy boundaries, offline mutation journals, parallel-safe tools, PII redaction, loaded-page offline behavior, AG-UI rendering, admin approvals, and agent-readable docs. The rubric requires no required failures, no required skips, an average score of at least 0.98, and category confidence ratings above their thresholds. Strict real-provider runs can target a dedicated Chrome profile through `EDGEKIT_CHROME_USER_DATA_DIR` or a normal Chrome remote-debugging session through `EDGEKIT_CHROME_CDP_URL`.',
