/**
 * Docs Q&A Mission Profile + Skills
 *
 * Second mission example using the Skills + Mission Profile pattern.
 * This demonstrates reusability of the architecture across very different
 * mission types (catalog shopping vs project documentation Q&A).
 *
 * NOTE ON CURRENT API STATUS (Wave 0 - 2026-05):
 * The `synthesis`, `policy`, and `uiAffordances` fields on Skills and Profiles
 * are currently **recommended authoring contracts** only.
 *
 * They are not yet consumed by the Edgekit runtime for enforcement.
 * They exist so that:
 *   - Developers and agents have a clear place to express intent.
 *   - Future runtime features (automatic approval gates, faithfulness checks,
 *     UI rendering hints) can consume them without breaking changes.
 *
 * Until runtime support lands, these fields are documentation + future-proofing.
 * Executable behavior (approvals, tool execution, rendering) is still controlled
 * via the normal `registerTools`, `registerActions`, and `configure()` paths.
 * Use `requiredTools` to name the app-owned executable tools a profile expects.
